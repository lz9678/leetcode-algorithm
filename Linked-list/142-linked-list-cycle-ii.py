Trick: 
Assume we have two pointers, one is moving faster than the another one (fast vs. slow, move 2 steps each time vs. move only 1 step): 
If there is no cycle in the linked list, aka. the linked list is a straight line, then it is not possible for the two pointers to meet each other, since the fast one will always reach the end (None) quicker than the slow one.
However, if there is a cycle, then the two pointers will definitely meet each other!
Is it possible that the fast pointer keep chasing the slow one in the cycle but they never meet?
Possible! This happens when the fast pointer is two nodes faster than the slow one. In this way, whenever the fast one approaches the slow one, the fast might directly skip the slow one without cathing it. So we could assume the fast pointer moves 2 nodes per time, and slow one moves 1 node per time. In this way, fast pointer is actually chasing the slow one with speed at 1 node per time, therefore fast pointer would definitely be able to catch slow one in the end.

Method 1:
Assume the fast travels at speed 2 and slow travels at speed 1
travel distance of fast = x + y + n(z + y)
travel distanct of slow = x + y
[x + y + n(z + y)]/2 = (x+y)/1
x = n(y+z) - y
In this equation, n>=1 which means before fast meets slow, it should travel for at least one full cycle
can n be zero? No. A quick math, if n is zero, this equation would become x = -y which is not valid
x = (n-1)(y+z)+z *** a very important equation!
when n=1, x=z
when n=100, x = 99(y+z)+z (it is still x = z but with additional cycles --> draw the graph to understand)
why won't slow travel as = x + y + k(z+y) like quick (travel more than one cycle?)
because fast would catch slow before slow travels a full cycle
